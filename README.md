## What can be improved

- UI / UX is shit
- Front architecture is shit
- Relying on NextJS routing to fetch feels like PHP done in React -> should use a store / global state and decouple UI from API calls
- Add interfaces in backend so it's easier to do dependency injection when it's needed
- DB model versioning using migration / evolution system
- Testing, this should be set up as early as possible
- Use docker for easier distribution
- Lots of other things I do not think about right now
